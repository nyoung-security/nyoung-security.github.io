## Why I'm Making This Change

After working as a mechanical engineer and running various ventures over the past several years, I'm transitioning into ethical hacking and cybersecurity. At 44, I'm looking for work that combines my technical background, systems thinking approach, and love of complex problem-solving with the flexibility of remote work.

## My Background

- Mechanical engineering degree with programming coursework (C#, Fortran, MATLAB)
- Built technical projects: Raspberry Pi/Arduino homebrew controller, database functions with Google Apps Scripts, web app with JavaScript/Node.js/Supabase/Vercel.
- Comfortable with Linux (been dual-booting for years) and command line
- Strong attention to detail and systematic problem-solving approach

## The Plan

I'm following a structured 9-12 month learning path to transition into a paid remote security position:

**Months 1-2:** Foundation building - learning core web vulnerabilities through PortSwigger Academy and TryHackMe
**Months 3-4:** Deepening technical skills - code reading, system architecture, practice applications  
**Months 5-6:** Real-world practice - bug bounties, first certification (eJPT)
**Months 7-12:** Building expertise and job hunting - portfolio development, continued learning, applications

## What I've Done Yesterday

- Completed first SQL injection labs on PortSwigger Web Security Academy
- Completed file path traversal lab

## What I've Done Today 

- Installed and configured Burp Suite Community Edition
- Set up this Jekyll blog on GitHub Pages to document my learning

## Initial Thoughts

The SQL injection labs felt intuitive - I've actually done similar exploratory testing on websites before without realizing it was a security technique. The concepts make sense given my programming background, though I know the complexity will ramp up significantly.

## Next Steps

- Continue through PortSwigger's server-side vulnerabilities path
- Master Burp Suite basics
- Set up proper documentation system for daily learning notes
- Complete authentication vulnerabilities section

I'll be posting updates on my progress, interesting vulnerabilities I learn about, and challenges I encounter.
